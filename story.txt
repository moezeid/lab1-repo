[yellow blocks of text begin to scroll, moving further away and to the top of the screen]
It is a period of civil war.
Rebel spaceships, striking
from a  hidden base, have 
won their fist victory
against the evil Galactic
Empire. 

During the battle, rebel
spies managed to steal
secret plans to the Empire's
ultimate weapon, the
DEATH STAR, an armored
space station with enough
power to destory an entire
planet.

Pursued by the Empire's
sinister agents, Princess
Leia races home aboard her
starship, custodian of the
stolen plans that can save
her poeple and restore
freedom to the galaxy....
